                        <h4>I currently run the following on my home server:</h4>
                        <p>
                            It started with a Raspberry Pi with an external hard disk drive used as a file server that got "upgraded" to a old laptop I no longer used.
                            When that laptop suddenly stopped working due to brittle solder to the gpu and I got tired of stripping it down and reflowing it in my oven(2 times..) and 
                            I finally bought an Intel Celeron G3930 for its unmatched performance, or was it its low power consumption?<br> At 15 watt at idle it is efficient enough to run 24/7.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><u>Openhab</u>
                                <p>Home automation with google integration. <br>
                                    Currently running 5 wifi lightbulbs(esp8266) reflashed with Tasmota to restrict the lightbulbs communication to the local network.<br>
                                    2 power switches to minimize energy consumption in standby.<br>
                                    Everything communication through a mqtt server.<br>
                                    By binding MotionEye and displaying both temperature and soil sensors on Openhab. Everything "smart" can be monitored or controlled from one app or webgui.
