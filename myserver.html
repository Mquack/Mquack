                        <h4>I currently run the following on my home server:</h4>
                        <p>
                            It started with a Raspberry Pi with an external hard disk drive used as a file server that got "upgraded" to a old laptop I no longer used.
                            When that laptop suddenly stopped working due to brittle solder to the gpu and I got tired of stripping it down and reflowing it in my oven(2 times..) and
                            I finally bought an Intel Celeron G3930 for its unmatched performance, or was it its low power consumption?<br> At 15 watt at idle it is efficient enough to run 24/7.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
															<u>Openhab</u>
                                <p>Home automation with google integration. <br>
                                    Currently running 5 wifi lightbulbs(with esp8266) reflashed with Tasmota(open source firmware) to restrict the
																		lightbulbs communication to the local network.<br>
																		With Tasmota running on the bulbs it's communication is limited to my local network and they mainly talk to my
																		server(you can configure the device with its webinterface)
																		with the help of a Mosquitto MQTT server.<br>
                                    Two power switches running Tasmota are used to minimize the energy consumption of other devices in standby.
                                    These are also communicating through the Mosquitto MQTT server.<br>
                                    By binding MotionEye and displaying both temperature and soil sensors on Openhab. Everything "smart"(i.e connected) can be
																		monitored or controlled from one app or webgui.<br>
																		All the devices can be automated with rules and patterns. For example a shut of timer to turn off all devices at night, or to
																		turn on light in the morning during the darker months of the year.

															<u>Wireguard-server</u>
                                <p>
																	Enables me to tunnel home from outside the LAN for maintenance or that single time you need to visit a webpage without SSL on
																	 an open wifi connection in an airport....<br>
																	Also useful to get rid of ads when you're outside of your home network, if you have a pi-hole service running.

                            </li>
                            <li>
															<u>Openvpn-server</u>
                                <p>Same as Wireguard but for devices or persons without wireguard.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
															<u>Local file server</u>
                                <p>Specific directories are accessible from specific IPs through NFS to lessen the need for large hard drive disks on our PCs.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
															<u>Pi-hole</u>
                                <p>
																	DNS sinkhole to filter unwanted content with an ever expanding blacklist.<br>
																	The easiest way to use it is to install it on a supported OS and force your router to look for a DNS server at your Pi-holes IP.
																	I often vpn home to get rid of ads when i'm out and about.
																	This is in my opinion one of the best services available for everyone with a Raspberry Pi laying around.

															<u>Temperature logger</u>
                                <p>
																	Receiving temperatures from a raspberry pi with two temperature sensors(see other project).
																</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
															<u>Soil moisture logger</u>
                                <p>Receiving the soil moisture levels in a plant pot sent from an Arduino with wifi(see other project).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><u>Jellyfin media system</u>
                                <p>Easily view my pictures and videos on other devices from anywhere.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
															<u>Nextcloud</u>
                                <p>
																	Self-hosted cloud service with (in my case) a self-signed certificate. Replaces services like Google Drive or Dropbox.<br>
																	A really nice service to have if you don't want to share your files with companies that don't value your privacy or if you
																	just want to have more control over your own information.
																</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
															<u>MotionEye</u>
                                <p>
																	Frontend for motion(open source security camera software for linux) that enables you to easily overview multiple cameras on
																	 your network from a single webinterface.<br>
																	 Useful if you for example have a couple of Rpis with cameras running motion. Can be viewed from outside your network without
																	  opening additional ports if you have a VPN server.
