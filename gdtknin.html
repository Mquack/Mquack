							<h2>2D platformer about a cool bunny kicking ass, made in Godot 3.2.3.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Kanin, swedish for rabbit, is a game about a rabbit on the hunt for the golden carrot.
                            In his way are the hordes of the wilderness, foxes, badgers and much more.</p>

                        <p>The game is still in its early stages with the basic environment and movements done.<br>
                            Mouse aiming on pc, dubble jump, wall jump, bouncing on mushrooms, collapsing leaves, spike traps and collectable items are implemented.</p>

												<p>Once of the main decisions that are left is wether the game should have one version across all platforms (Windows/Linux and Android/iOS)
												or if there should be two different games with different game mechanics.<br>
														This is mainly because of the limitations on mobile devices touch screen control. <br>
														One example is the aim and shoot functionality that works seamlessly on PC with the mouse.
														While I've created a working "touch to aim and shoot" functionality for the game, I must either
														 shrink the viewable display area (to accommodate space for the control buttons) or ignore the touch
														 input for aim+shoot in the lower right and left area of the display(to avoid misfires when using control buttons).<br>
														 Another approach would be to separate the aim and shoot so that a user uses touch to aim with the current
														 aim sprite and then a touch button to shoot. Moving ones hand away from the main controls would however
														 decrease the fluidity of the gameplay.
													 	</p>
														<p>
															Another solution would be some kind of "aimbot" where the player locks on to enemies. Either by auto-lock or touch-to-lock.
														</p>
														<p>
															This project is a collaboration between me and an artist. This is the first time that I've closly worked on a programming-project with
															a non-programmer. It's been really interesting and educational to see how we each approach different problems for different solutions.<br>
