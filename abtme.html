							<h2>About me.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I usually have a couple of projects to work on in my free time. Most of them are from ideas that i think would either make my life easier or 
							more interesting.<br> 
							Others are just for the sake of learning something new or for the fun of it.<br> 
							The Openhab server is one example of both, it was 
							interesting to learn how different devices could communicate with the server and the finished project is really useful day to day.<br>

							Different projects familiarized me with different programs and programming languages. Testing different programs taught me how to use VirtualBox as a sandbox,
							I got to use Wireshark a lot more when figuring out some network connected devices and when i needed a simple GUI for a project I took a shortcut and used a webinterface
							with html, css and Javascript.
